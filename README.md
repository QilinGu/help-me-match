# help-me-match
The repository contains the source files for the iOS application I'm developing named "Help Me Match".  The application allows a user to select the various clothing items of their outfit, stores their choices, and then uses common fashion rules to provide suggestions for color coordinating and adhering to dress codes.

#Goal of this project
While I'm happy with the actual premise of this application, this project was used mainly as a learning experience over my sophomore year summer.  I was initially interested in mobile app development, so I started off by watching and reading some tutorials online to learn the basics of Swift.  But I still didn't know "where to go next" in a sense, and felt like I needed something to just run with when I wanted to program.  I'm pretty big into fashion, so this application became a way for me to bridge two of my passions in a productive way.  
###While working on this project, I gained...
- Proficiency in Swift
- An understanding of the MVC design pattern
- Familiarity and working knowledge of Cocoa Touch 
- The ability to use Xcode efficiently (including Interface Builder and Auto Layout)
- Experience with GitHub 
- The skill of parsing through Stack Overflow posts
 
**And, above all else, I learned that my CS education could be translated to the real world...** 
and that was pretty cool.

#In progress:
- Need to finalize the process to provide users feedback on their outfits
- Getting the application approved and posted to the App Store
