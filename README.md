# help-me-match
The repository contains the source files for the iOS application I'm developing named "Help Me Match".  The application allows a user to select the various clothing items of their outfit, stores their choices, and then uses common fashion rules to provide suggestions for color coordinating and adhering to dress codes.

#Goal of this project
While I'm happy with the actual premise of this application, I really used this project as a learning experience over my sophomore year summer.  I started off with some tutorials online to learn the basics of Swift, but I wanted something to just run with and actual create something tangible.  Even though it's not completely finished and polished, I'm happy with how its coming and the progress I've made.
##What I learned about while working on this project
- Swift
- MVC design pattern
- Cocoa Touch framework
- Xcode (including Interface Builder and Auto Layout)
- GitHub
- Parsing through MANY StackOverflow posts to find what I needed 
 
Above all else, I learned that I could translate my CS education into something applicable to the real world... and that's pretty cool.

#In progress features
- Need to finalize the process to provide users feedback on their outfits
- Getting the application approved and posted to the App Store
