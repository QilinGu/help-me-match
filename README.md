# help-me-match
The repository contains the source files for the iOS application I'm developing named "Help Me Match".  The application allows a user to select the various clothing items of their outfit, stores their choices, and then uses common fashion rules to provide suggestions for color coordinating and adhering to dress codes.

#Goal of this project
While I'm happy with the actual premise of this application, this project was used mainly as a learning experience over my sophomore year summer.  I was interested in mobile app development at the start of the summer, so I started off by watching and reading some tutorials online to learn the basics of Swift.  But even though I was doing these tutorials on my own accord, I felt as if they were too structured and still didn't think I was branching out from the realm of instructor-led programming.  I needed a project to run with whenever I wanted to program, something that would actually force me to experiment and get some practical experience in the "real world" of computer science.  
   This project became just that for me.  
   I'm pretty big into fashion, so this project became a way for me to bridge two of my passions in a productive way. 
###While working on this project, I gained...
- Proficiency in Swift
- An understanding of the MVC design pattern
- Familiarity and working knowledge of Cocoa Touch 
- The ability to use Xcode efficiently (including Interface Builder and Auto Layout)
- Experience with GitHub 
- The skill of parsing through Stack Overflow posts


#In progress:
- Need to finalize the process to provide users feedback on their outfits
- Getting the application approved and posted to the App Store
